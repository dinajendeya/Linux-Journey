# 🐧 Linux Journey — LabEx Learning + Hands‑On Practice (Kali Linux VM)

Welcome to my Linux learning repository!
This repo documents my full journey through the Linux Path on LabEx, where I practice commands and concepts inside a real Linux environment using **Kali Linux on VirtualBox.**

The notes here are dense, summarized, and topic‑based.  
They do NOT replace the original LabEx lessons — instead, they highlight my learning progress and provide quick, clear reference material.

This repository is aimed at mastering the essential Linux fundamentals, building a strong, confident, and practical foundation through hands‑on practice.

For the full learning experience, I highly recommend exploring the LabEx website while reading my notes.

## 🌐 Official LabEx Website  
👉 https://labex.io  
LabEx provides excellent interactive Linux labs.  
My notes here only summarize what I personally learned and practiced.

# 🖥️ My Practice Environment

All commands, exercises, and scripts in this repository were tested on:

- **Kali Linux (latest version)**
- Running as a virtual machine in **Oracle VirtualBox**
- Full manual practice (typing every command, not copying)
- Safe, isolated, beginner‑friendly environment

This ensures real hands‑on skill building — not just theory.

## 🛠️ How YOU Can Install Kali Linux on Your PC

If you want to practice Linux the same way I do:

### 1️⃣ Download VirtualBox  
👉 https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

### 2️⃣ Download Kali Linux ISO  
👉 https://www.kali.org/get-kali/

### 3️⃣ Create a Virtual Machine in VirtualBox  
- Choose **Linux → Debian (64‑bit)**  
- Allocate **2–4 GB RAM**  
- Allocate **20–40 GB storage**  
- Boot from the Kali ISO and install

### 4️⃣ Start practicing Linux commands safely inside the VM.
